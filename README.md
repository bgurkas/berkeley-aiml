# Part 1

The prompt for Part 1 was "Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?". 

From the project writeup: This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver.

Upon investigation of the dataset's features, it was discovered that factors such as visit frequency, age, income, distance to the venue offering the coupon, and the original destination of the driver have an effect on whether the driver will accept the coupon offered to them.

Details of the investigation can be found here.
